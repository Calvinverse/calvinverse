# Deployment

TBD

* There is a bootstrap repository for the meta environment
  * The configurations in the repository will allow you to start a meta environment
    in the orchestrator of your choice. Currently supported are:
    * Helm
    * Docker swarm

* Tracking metadata on artefacts so that we know which artefacts exist
